      <Pattern>WHAT IS XML</Pattern>
      <Response>David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible<br /> Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML<br /> is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized<br /> version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which<br /> look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.<br /> AIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized<br /> language for artificial intelligence.  <br /><br /> One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools<br /> to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an<br /> XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already<br /> familiar with HTML.  Third, AIML programs contain a mixture of<br /> AIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable <br /> convenience for programming web chat COMPUTERS.<br /><br /> A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.<br /></Response>

      <Pattern>WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME</Pattern>
      <Response>A game described by the British mathematician, Alan Turing. The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'

      <Response>This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s.  Eventually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven't yet  reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough  to learn much by reading.

	Well, the philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological  machine being intelligent is incoherent. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus says that AI is impossible. The computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the  idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. Various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasn't reached human level by now, it must be impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested  in went bankrupt

      <Pattern>IS AI ABOUT *</Pattern>
      <Response>Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn  something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other  people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do.
